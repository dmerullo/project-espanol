*Project ESPAÑOL* is a collection of 10,000 classical Spanish-language poems from 200 authors covering 500 years. I analyzed verb forms across all grammatical tenses for the 550+ most common verbs, and computationally grouped the poems into 4 difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert) to guide discovery for practice and study.

I scraped the poems from [https://poesi.as/](https://poesi.as/). I only included poems whose authors lived before the start of World War II (1939)-- I thought this was a safe time to only include texts in the public domain, but this date may change as I learn more about copyright laws. 

In creating this project, I came across a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/linhd-postdata/poesi.as) from the [POSTDATA Project](https://postdata.linhd.uned.es/) that similarly contains classical Spanish-language poems. Although I did all of the work here independently, I want to reference this project because it predates *Project ESPAÑOL*.
